# Task - 6 Date and Time Functions

## Objective

- Manipulate and query data based on date and time values.

## Requirement

- Use built-in date functions (e.g., `DATEDIFF`, `DATEADD`, or your SQL dialectâ€™s equivalent) to calculate intervals or adjust dates.
- Write a query to filter records based on date ranges (e.g., orders placed within the last 30 days).
- Format date outputs if necessary using functions like `CONVERT` or `TO_CHAR`.
